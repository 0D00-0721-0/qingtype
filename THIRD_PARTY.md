# Third-party components

QingType is a derivative of [Squirrel](https://github.com/rime/squirrel), based on
tag `1.1.2` (`876adebaf2f612951dcdca8a591de65401222b9a`). Squirrel's authorship
and GPL-3.0 license are preserved in the source and `LICENSE.txt`.

- **librime**: BSD-3-Clause; API headers are pinned through the `librime` submodule
  at `a251145d3aafa33871824a40bbec04c966bd8b56`. See `librime/LICENSE`.
- **Runtime and standard schemas**: local builds and CI extract the official
  Squirrel 1.1.2 package without installing it. `dependencies/runtime.lock.json`
  pins the source, byte count and SHA-256
  `614746013212937623d5bbab9901e9c43d1ec937aa32307d6b6092a05e308287`.
  The preview bundles librime, plugins and standard resources; legacy optional
  `.gram` files are excluded. GPL, librime BSD, Yams MIT and Xiaohe license texts
  are included, together with 16 additional checked notice files in `licenses/`.
  `dependencies/components.lock.json` records their fixed source revisions and
  SHA-256; `runtime-files.lock.json` checks every extracted runtime/resource file.
  Exact binary-to-source rebuild provenance is not yet established: the PKG and
  same-version SDK have different UUIDs and Lua patch versions. See
  [dependency evidence and limits](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md). Explicit developer overrides are recorded
  by `capture-baseline.py` and are not the default distribution source.
- **Xiaohe double pinyin schema**: vendored from
  [rime/rime-double-pinyin](https://github.com/rime/rime-double-pinyin), commit
  `01a13287cbd27819be1c34fa1ddc1b3643d5001b`. Upstream BSD license is included as
  `data/qingtype/LICENSE.double-pinyin`; the simplified QingType variant extends it.
- **Sparkle**: not linked into QingType's command line development build. The
  original Squirrel project and submodule declaration remain for upstream history.

The build does not use Squirrel's update feed. DMG preview packaging and optional
Developer ID/notarization scripts exist; no valid identity was available locally,
so signing with Developer ID and notarization have not been performed. There is
an opt-in GitHub app updater in 0.6.0. A clearly marked, unnotarized preview is published through
GitHub Releases; this does not represent Apple notarization or stable-release acceptance.

- **Squirrel Panel**: package-manifest, schema-level grammar configuration and
  exclusive deployment lifecycle were informed by the local GPL-3.0 source of
  [wolfprince12/squirrel-Panel](https://github.com/wolfprince12/squirrel-Panel),
  commit `2df9e6fcb4fd1742bf9ba8d296a276ba6ef4d21f`. QingType's import manager
  and deployment report are independently implemented for its dedicated data directory.
- **Yams 5.0.6**: MIT, pinned to
  `0d9ee7ea8c4ebd4a489ad7a73d5c6cad55d6fed3` in `dependencies/Package.resolved`.
  Its license and libyaml's MIT notice are bundled with both applications.
- **Wanxiang model**: optional official download or local import, not bundled.
  The former RIME-LMDG repository now resolves to
  [amzxyz/rime-wanxiang-data](https://github.com/amzxyz/rime-wanxiang-data), whose
  original data uses CC-BY-4.0; third-party components have their own notices.
  The app uses the LTS release's SHA-256 and size, followed by grammar-header and
  index checks. Source/release/checksum remain in model metadata. The simplified
  model tested on 2026-10-27 had SHA-256
  `e34500ab44626dc039a0641792ecba98ab63307646eb3d29186be56608ffe094`.
  No user's existing model, word entries or learning databases are redistributed.

- **Runtime plugins and transitive libraries**: `librime-lua` (BSD-3-Clause;
  embedded Lua 5.4.6, MIT), `librime-octagram` (GPL-3.0), `librime-predict`
  (BSD-3-Clause), glog and LevelDB (BSD-3-Clause), yaml-cpp (MIT), marisa
  (BSD-2-Clause option), OpenCC (Apache-2.0), Boost/utf8cpp (Boost Software
  License), Darts-clone (BSD), and X11 keysyms (permissive notices).
  Their source references and full notice text hashes are in
  `dependencies/components.lock.json`; the exact PKG bytes remain the runtime
  distribution source. Squirrel's build recipe and the Rime SDK provide plugin
  revision evidence, not byte-equivalence to the PKG. GPL octagram source recipe:
  [dfcc151](https://github.com/lotem/librime-octagram/tree/dfcc15115788c828d9dd7b4bff68067d3ce2ffb8).

- **Input-source cache diagnosis**: the macOS per-application keyboard cache
  repair was independently corroborated by
  [Qingjian issue 346](https://github.com/qingjian-team/qingjian/issues/346).
  The cache backup helper here is independently implemented with a strict
  filename allowlist, reversible backups and symlink/root-boundary tests.

- **Rime Ice**: GPL-3.0, [iDvel/rime-ice](https://github.com/iDvel/rime-ice).
  Optional complete scheme installed by the user from the official release or
  a local folder; not bundled in the app or Git repository. Its license is copied
  with each installation, and a manifest records resource hashes and provenance.
  Reference engine fixture: commit `da1fbe602e38f26db846fa10120ee64c2b0324c0`.
  The official full.zip inspected on 2026-10-27 had SHA-256
  `4e1e677cab1866e7610a350cd85b7bd07d1eeb58aeefff275a1ab3c060515d5e`.
  The package includes third-party dictionaries and Lua/OpenCC resources with
  upstream attribution; audit all component permissions again before public
  redistribution. Current installation retains those source notices.
